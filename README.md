## Code Review

Code review is a great way for knowledge sharing between author and reviewer;
it works both ways.

It is a dialog, author reveals his story first, then reviewer learns from it
and could add his knowledge to it at the same time.

## Knowledge

Reviewer could share his knowledge in a form of a short comments or small code
gists. Sometimes it is enough, while in other cases, a longer story should
be told and shared.

## Long story short

Reviewer is on his schedule, so there is no time telling long stories every
time. The story should be told once and then referenced when there is a need to
repeat it once again.

Write your story once, and share it via `duck-review` story library.

## Method

_Rubber duck debugging_ is great, so is _rubber duck code review_.

The essence of _rubber duck_ method is that you have to explain your story to
someone in order to understand it better. That said, it does not matter who
would listen, so _rubber duck_ being a silent listener is indispensable.

Here is the rules:

- explain your story to a _rubber duck_
- write you story down as you explain it
- don't offend people
- streamline the narrative
- iterate until _rubber duck_ is happy

## Benefits

Compared to interpersonal communication on code review, _rubber duck code
review_ allows you to focus on a story and arguments you use. Refined knowledge
is always better than unsupported feelings and rants about the code.

You would become a better programmer as you explain, and given that you keep
story _written_, you could reference to it later, so no need to repeat yourself.
